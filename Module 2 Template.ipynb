    "## Verify and validate your analysis: \n",
    "To verify our analysis, we first checked that our interpolation results made logical and numerical sense. The value obtained from the linear interpolation fell between the two known data points, which aligns with expected behavior, while the quadratic interpolation produced a higher fibrosis value than measurements at greater depths, suggesting potential overfitting. This observation confirmed that the linear model more accurately represented the biological trend of fibrosis progression. To further validate our results, we compared our interpolated fibrosis values to the corresponding data provided by Dr. Pierce-Cottler at the same tissue depth, finding close agreement for the linear prediction. We also compared both interpolation methods and determined that the linear approach produced values more consistent with real data and biological expectations. Finally, our observed trend, showing that fibrosis increases with depth, is consistent with subpleural-dominant patterns of fibrosis reported in bleomycin-induced mouse models by Lee (2014) and Decologne (2009). Together, these findings confirm that our analysis is both internally consistent and supported by established research, validating the reliability of our image-based quantification pipeline."

    "## Conclusions and Ethical Implications: \n",
    "Our analysis demonstrated that the extent of fibrosis in bleomycin-treated mouse lungs increases progressively with tissue depth, indicating that deeper regions of the lung exhibit more extensive scarring. The linear interpolation method provided more accurate and biologically realistic predictions of fibrosis compared to the quadratic model, as it better aligned with the measured data and published findings such as those by Gilhodes et al. (2017), who used similar image-based quantification methods. These results suggest that a depth-based image analysis pipeline can effectively estimate fibrosis at unmeasured depths, which has important implications for the design of a new biopsy device capable of targeting specific regions of diseased tissue. From an ethical perspective, improving biopsy precision could greatly benefit patients by reducing the invasiveness of diagnostic procedures and minimizing the risk of sampling error. It would also support clinicians in making more accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions. However, these benefits come with the responsibility to ensure that automated image analysis tools are validated across diverse datasets and used transparently to avoid bias or misinterpretation. As such technologies move closer to clinical use, careful oversight and data protection will be essential to uphold patient safety and privacy."

    "## Limitations and Future Work: \n",
    "*Although our analysis provided valuable insight into how fibrosis varies with tissue depth, several limitations must be acknowledged. Our dataset was relatively small, as we analyzed only a subset of the available histological images, which may limit the statistical strength and generalizability of our findings. Additionally, interpolation assumes a smooth and consistent relationship between depth and fibrosis, which may oversimplify biological variability within lung tissue. The classification of fibrotic versus healthy regions was also dependent on image contrast and thresholding methods, introducing potential sources of error in the white-pixel quantification. Future work should focus on analyzing all 78 images in the dataset to improve accuracy and confidence in the model. Expanding the pipeline to incorporate 3D image reconstruction could provide a more complete view of fibrosis distribution across the lung. Implementing machine learning techniques could automate the segmentation process and enhance precision in fibrosis detection. Finally, validating this approach on human lung biopsy samples would strengthen the clinical relevance of our findings and move closer to developing a biopsy device capable of precisely targeting fibrotic regions for improved diagnosis and treatment planning.*"
