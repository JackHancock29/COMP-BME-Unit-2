    "* Prevalence & incidence: 132,000 to 200,000 people in the U.S. live with it. 5.8 per 100,000 persons are diagnosed each year. Currently 17.7 per 100,000 people are living with IPF. \n",
    "* Risk factors (genetic, lifestyle): over 50 years of age, being male, smoking tabacco, genetic factors, and viral exposure\n",
    "* Symptoms: difficulty breathing, persistent dry cough, fatigue\n",
    "* Standard of care treatment(s): supplemental oxygen and medicine to slow progression, the only cure is a lung transplant\n",
    "* Biological mechanisms (anatomy, organ physiology, cell & molecular physiology): The alveoli are typically covered by soft flexible tissue transporting blood. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the soft tissue has permanent scaring. The cause for excess scar tissue is unknown. "
